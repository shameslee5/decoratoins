# decoratoins
Decorators dynamically alter the functionality of a function, method, or class without having to directly use subclasses or change the source code of the function being decorated. Using [decorators](https://www.lgcdecorators.co.uk/our-services/bathroom-fitting-bathroom-renovation/) in Python also ensures that your code is DRY.
